Create a row level trigger for the customers table that would fire for INSERT or UPDATE or
DELETE operations performed on the CUSTOMERS table. This trigger will display the
salary difference between the old & new Salary.
CUSTOMERS(ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY)

  CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
        ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        NAME VARCHAR(100),
        AGE INT,
        ADDRESS VARCHAR(255),
        SALARY DECIMAL(10, 2)
    );

Table created.

 CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER salary_difference_trigger
    BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON CUSTOMERS
    FOR EACH ROW
    DECLARE
        old_salary NUMBER;
        new_salary NUMBER;
    BEGIN
        IF INSERTING OR UPDATING THEN
            old_salary := NVL(:OLD.SALARY, 0);
           new_salary := NVL(:NEW.SALARY, 0);
           DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Salary difference: ' || (new_salary - old_salary));
       ELSIF DELETING THEN
           old_salary := NVL(:OLD.SALARY, 0);
           DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Salary before deletion: ' || old_salary);
       END IF;
   END;
   /
